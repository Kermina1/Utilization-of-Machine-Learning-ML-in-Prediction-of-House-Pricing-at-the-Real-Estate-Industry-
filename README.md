# Abstract
This study elucidates the transformative impact of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, resulting in
the emergence of the property technology concept. This phenomenon has significantly affected
and revolutionized traditional practices in the real estate industry, especially in the aftermath of the
COVID-19 pandemic, with the integration of advanced technologies, including but not limited to
artificial intelligence and machine learning. In the real estate industry, predicting house prices is
an essential yet complex task. Achieving accurate predictions is made possible through machine
learning technology, offering benefits to various stakeholders, including buyers, sellers, investors,
and companies. The study explains and examines the significance of utilizing machine learning
for accurate house price predictions, exemplifying the concept of property technology. This is
demonstrated through an in-depth analysis of the Ames Housing dataset sourced from Kaggle. This
involves detailed explanations of data exploration, data pre-processing, model building, and
evaluation of models. The objective is to identify the model with the highest performance in
predicting house prices. The study employs and compares multiple machine learning regression
techniques using three main metrics which are R-squared, Mean Square Error and Root Meen
Square Error, showcasing the practical implementation of house price prediction including Lasso,
K-Nearest Neighbor Regressor, Support Vector Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, Random
Forest Regressor, Gradient Booster Regressor, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, LightGBM Regressor,
and Voting Regressor. Our Champion Model was XGBoost regressor achieving highest R² squared,
lowest MAE and lowest RMSE while the worst performing model was Decision Tree model with
lowest R² squared, highest MAE and RMSE.
